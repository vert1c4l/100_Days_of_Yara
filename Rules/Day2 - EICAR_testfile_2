/*
After reading over the YARA Performance guide at https://github.com/Neo23x0/YARA-Performance-Guidelines/, 
I wanted to go back and rewrite Day1 using the guidance from that write-up.  I also wanted to change up the
formatting for the metadata to look more uniform with other individuals writing

Ultimately, I want to make sure that I am mastering the basics first before moving on to more advanced and complex
rules.  As Bruce Lee said, “I am not afraid of a person who knows 10000 kicks. But I am afraid of a person who knows one kick but practices it for 10000 times.”
