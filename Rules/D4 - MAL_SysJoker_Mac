/*
Another simple rule that I have not tested yet.  I am feeling more comfortable in writing the rules and getting a good idea of how to use different key words.  I don't think I've written a ***good*** rule yet, but I think I am learning.  As mentioned for Day 3, I need to set up a good way to grab samples and test these rules to make sure they actually work.  Good to have the theory, but means jack shit if I can't get it to be practical.
