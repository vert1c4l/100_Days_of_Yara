# 100_Days_of_Yara

I've never written a single Yara rule.  I want to get better and this is a good way to get started (*I hope*).  

Don't expect anything fancy.  I'm starting small and working my way up.  I'll be relying heavily upon the documentation at https://yara.readthedocs.io/ and any public samples that I can find through various malware sandboxes (Any.Run, Tria.ge, Joe Sandbox, Hybrid Analysis, etc.)

If you come across this and want to help me improve, please feel free to critique me.  All I ask is that if you do offer criticism, please provide a reason for it.  Don't just say that it sucks because it sucks; tell me why it sucks and how to **not** make it suck.

Cheers.
